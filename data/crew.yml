  bio: >
    David Morgan-Brown is the founder and intern of Carpool Studios. He was born Ronaldo el San Juaz in Osaka, Japan, where he was raised by telepathic wolves to become an investment banker at Pierce & Pierce, but Morgan-Brown declined this luxurious and sexy lifestyle in favour for the life of a semi-alcoholic, dole-bludger video creator (specifically in the tragicomedy genre). Morgan-Brown, along with a little bit of assistance from the other Carpool members, make approximately twenty-seven videos per week, but only release the best ones on Carpool.


    In his spare time, Morgan-Brown enjoys spending time sitting on an uncomfortable wooden chair being miserable, and has aspirations to become history’s greatest hashtag activist.

  bio: >
    Michael Butcher was born in 1991 in Western Australia, as a child he showed no extraordinary talent at all. He was taken to a leading child psychologist who was astounded with how totally unremarkable Michael was. “I've never seen, in all my years of practice, a child who is so very mediocre.” said veteran child psychologist Doctor Harold Shrenberger. “Most of the children who I've seen are extremely talented in composing symphonies, abstract mathematics and painting. But Michael, amazingly, displays none of these talents, nor the capacity to master any intense diciplines.”


    Truly, Michael was a special child. Many unremarkable years passed, until one day in his late teens, he discovered his true passion in life, which was recording “funny” voices into a shitty microphone and putting those voices over the top of movies. The world of comedy was never the same again. 


    Now as an emotionally stunted adult, along with David Morgan-Brown and Brett Jones, he writes and fumbles his way through directing some of the groundbreaking short films you see on Carpool today. The future looks bright for Michael Butcher, unless he dies today... Or tomorrow.

- name: "Brett Jones"
  slug: "brett"
  roles: "Camera operator, and occasional editor"
  bio: >
    Mild–mannered designer by day, with the power of ⌘Tab Brett transforms into his identically mannered alter–ego; Carpool’s video editor (and also designer) by night.


    Preferring to remain on the side of the camera not being filmed, Brett serves primarily as cameraman for Carpool videos, except for when he must step into frame — invariably to play the role of someone who cannot act.


    Brett is also chiefly responsible for post–production; handling editing, visual effects and compositing. When not putting off these responsibilities, he also applies his considerable experience in clicking and dragging to maintain the Carpool website.
